            <p>Python (pronounced <i>/pth:ff/</i> in parseltongue) is a programming language originally developed by snake people in the early 1900s and plagiarised by humans in the 1980s. It was originally invented as a way to implement the Snake Game, which had previously only been realised mechanically using levers, ropes, and real apples (click here to learn more about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jogJHY-h7n8" target="_blank">apples too were plagiarised</a>, this time by the human Steven Jobs to form the basis of his tech company, iApple or iPle for short - and notice that even the i symbolises a snake positioned vertically eating an apple) but never took off, due to the constraints posed by the laws of nature, namely that snakes do not grow proportionally to the amount of apples they eat, nor can they instantly move faster after eating, as this would cause a stomach ache.</p> 
            <p>As the years progressed, humans realised there was more that could be done with the language, and Python started being used in other things like deep learning as well as regular learning. These other uses are what will be covered in this documentation.</p>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>Here are the things I'm going to assume you already know, so I won't explain them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to install and open a Python IDE</li>
                <li>Which Python version we are using</li>
                <li>The best approach to learning</li>
                <li>How the brain processes new information</li>
                <li>What is the nature of concsiosness</li>
                <li>How to spell consciosness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If there is at least one of these things above that you do not know, you will literally not be able to comprehend anything that is discussed in this documentation. We recommend you watch enough YouTube clips until you learn all the things in this list, then when you come back you will absorb the information in this documentation without hesitation.</p>

            <header>Hello Snake world</header>
            <p>Much like a printer, a <code>print</code> statement simply prints whatever message is within the brackets that is proceeded by the word <i>print</i>. For example, <code>print("text")</code> prints the text <i>text</i>. Of course, as with a regular printer, in order for the message to successfully print, you must have sufficient paper and ink inside of your computer or whatever device you are programming in.</p>
            <p>A common phrase that beginner programming tutorials for humans have the beginners print is "Hello world". Originally, snake people tutorials for beginners instructed the printing of the phrase "Hello Snake World". Hence, "Hello World" is a way for humans to mock snake people, having successfully plagiarised their programming language without repercussions.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>A variable is simply a reference, aka a pointer, to "bit of memory". The pointer can point to anything or anyone, as long as the pointee can conceptually be thought of as a "bit of memory". For example, it can point to an object, like a memory stick or a chair, or it can point to a pigeon, if you can locate one.</p>
            <p>There are 3 ways of declaring a variable in Python:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can do something like this: <code>theVariableName = "witches"</code>: you type the variable name, theVariableName, in this case, followed by what it refers to, which is witches in this case. Additionally, you are legally obligated to write the variable name in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="_blank">camel case</a>", which is an idea humans plagirised from camel people, who write their sentences withCapitalLettersInsteadOfSpaces as an attempt to confuse others. This way of declaring variables is pretty lame, though.</li>
                <li>Another method for declaring a variable is the M.S. method, where M.S. stands for Michael Scott. In the documentary series, The Office, Michael Scott declares variables by shouting loudly, "I declare...variable!", and then shouting the variable name followed by what it references. For example, one might shout, "I'm losing my mind! Signs." The first part of that phrase is the variable name, I'm losing my mind!, and the second part of that sentence is the movie that is being referenced, Signs, which is a religious movie about sign language.</li>
                <li>Lastly, but not leastly, you can create a variable by simply pointing at things. When you employ this method, you are the variable name, aka the pointer, that is pointing to the variable. However, you can only point at things that vary, which includes, but is not limited to: the housing market, the S&P index, and Keanu Reeves's beard. Again, you could also point at a pigeon.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="While_statements">
            <header>While statements</header>
            <p>While <code>while</code> statements can be very powerful tools, they can also cause infinite loops if you are not careful. An example of an infinite loop is a Groundhog-Day/Russian-Doll-type scenario, where a person relives the same time frame over and over again. To avoid these kinds of loops, you must live your life to its fullest and seize your opportunities in life to be a good person. Once you are satisfied with your life, you can safely use while loops. This is an example of a while statement:<br>
                <code>while i < 6:<br>
                print("i is greater than 6")</code></p>
            <p>As you can see above, you just type "while" followed by the condition you are whiling, in this case, we are checking that the variable i is less than 6, and if this is not the case then we print the message that i is greater than 6, which may actually be incorrect because i could be equal to 6. Hence, this is a needlessly confusing example. However, since you <a href="#What_you_should_already_know">already know</a> what the best approach to learning is, otherwise you would not be reading this documentation, you know needless confusion is the foundation of good education.</p>
